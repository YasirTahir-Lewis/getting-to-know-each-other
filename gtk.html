    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I am a College senior majoring in Computer Science. I have always wanted to become a Pilot so I got my Private license last year from a local flying school. I was also interested in CS field. One of my hobbies has been programming since I was young.

    <h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
    <p>I love coding. I started programming as a hobby when I was 15. My uncle was a computer engineer so he used to guide me with everything. Since I was a kid I have wanted to go in CS field and explore a lot but I changed my mind to become a commercial
        Pilot but then due to some circumstances I came back in CS field and now I working to become a Software developer or Data Scientist one day.</p>

    <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
    <p>I am an International student. Orignially, I belong to Pakistan, I came in US in 2017, I had a big culture and weather shock but now I am well adjusted here and I like it here a lot. I don't do parties and drinking for obvious reasons but there is
        still a lot to enjoy in our culture. I am living with my family in Wisconsin now so that's great and I try to be positive and happy all the time and be grateful to God for what I have.</p>
